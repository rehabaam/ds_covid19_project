# Datascientest project - Analysis of Covid-19 chest x-rays

## Project description

In order to diagnose patients with Covid-19, the analysis of chest X-rays is a possibility to be explored to more easily detect positive cases. If the classification through deep learning of such data proves effective in detecting positive cases, then this method can be used in hospitals and clinics when traditional testing cannot be done.
